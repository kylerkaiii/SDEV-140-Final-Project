The purpose of this application is a GUI for users to be able to have aid when creating a campaign for a TTRPG

Name: Story Board Tool Belt (SBTB) 

Purpose: The purpose of this is to be a tool that game masters can use to help them build a story for their campaign. 

Reason: There are many tools for players to help create a character or to help create a background. There aren't many applications that are made to help a game master decide plot points for their story or elements of chacrters. This application will help them with organzing and recommending information for a game master, while they are creating their world. 

What do we want to accomplish? We want this to be able to help organize your thoughts into a cohesive world. With different sections that a user can edit, and image placement, the game master will be able to update, edit, and delete their story. 

Target Audience: The target audience is 12+, all genders and races, for those who are passionate about creating a fun and interesting world for their players.
